# OSSR notebook examples
This git project contains a metadata wrapper for the [example notebooks](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/escape2020/wp3/eossr/-/tree/master/examples/notebooks) provided as part of the [OSSR client library](https://escape2020.pages.in2p3.fr/wp3/eossr/README.html).

The `codemeta.json` and `requirements.txt` files describe the Jupyter notebooks, their dependencies and how to run them.

The `requirements.txt` file in particular may include additional dependencies for things like `matplotlib`, which may be required to generate graphs for the examples but are not required by the OSSR itself.
