# OSSR-Python-library-notebook-examples
This git project contains a metadata wrapper for the OSSR example notebooks.

The `codemeta.json` and `requirements.txt` files describe the Jupyter notebooks, their dependencies and how to run them.

The `requirements.txt` file in particular may include additional dependencies for things like `matplotlib`, which may be required to generate graphs for the examples but are not required by the OSSR itself.
